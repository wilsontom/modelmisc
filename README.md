#### What is forestTools ?

`forestTools` is an R package which contains a collection of functions which can be used alongside `randomForest` models to provide extra measures of robustness to models aswell as helping the user to visualise and explore constructed forest's.

While a number of the functions are specific to Leo Breiman's implementation of `randomForest`, a large number of the functions could be used with any method of high dimensionality data analysis(SVM, PLS, kNN, naiveBayes, etc..). The functions have been written in way to make them as compatible as possible with models other than `randomForest's`.
